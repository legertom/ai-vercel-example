## A poem

In the realm of web development, there's a name that's sure to bring cheer,
Next.js is the tool that developers hold dear.
With version 14, they've reached new heights,
A beast of a framework that's here to stay and brighten up nights.

Its power and might are hard to deny,
A React-based platform that takes flight.
Smart Routing, Server Side Rendering, and more,
Next.js helps developers build faster, and they adore.

From pages to APIs, it's all so grand,
With Next.js, you're in a land of pure command.
So come on down, don't be shy,
And join the Next.js crew, before you say goodbye.

It's fun and easy, with a smile and a wink,
Next.js helps developers build, and they quickly blink.
Innovation is its middle name, it's true,
Next.js is here to stay, and that's what you do.
